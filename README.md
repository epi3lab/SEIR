# SEIR
The code for an SEIR model for COVID-19 infection in Chile, including different clinical trajectories of infection, interventions to reduce transmission, and comparisons to healthcare capacity.

We used data from census 2017 to project population in 2020 in Chile.

All the functions that actually run the model and process the parameters are in the code/functions.R file

If you want to run the code to produce the same outputs as Shiny but without dealing with the app structure, you can use the R scripts

Caution: This model is still a work in progress and will be updated continuously.
